- 👋 Hi, I’m Kane Stewart

- 🥚 I'm creating the <a href="https://www.eggacademy.co.nz/">Egg Academy</a> - a sacred place where we teach teenagers the digital and entrepreneurial skills through the creation of game-related content 

- 🕹️ I also live with a house of gamers called the <a href="https://www.tribehouse.co.nz/">Tribe House</a> in Christchurch, New Zealand

- 💞️ I’m always looking for people that can create game-related content that has an underlying meaningful purpose. 

- 🌱 I think we have a real chance of disrupting the broken education system through games
